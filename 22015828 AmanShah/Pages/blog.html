                <h4>Improved Communication</h4>
                <p>Communication is an essential aspect for people as it helps them interact with each other. In the old
                    days, communication often required travel which could end up taking days or months. This was made a
                    lot simpler with the telegram and eventually, with Graham Bell inventing the telephone. The
                    telephone allowed people to communicate over vast distances. The commmunication has help us to
                    contact our teacher and our college easily, we are able to interact with our teacher through emails
                    hangout or by telephone. </p>

                <h4>Personalized Learning Opportunities</h4>
                <p>Technology allows 24/7 access to educational resources. Classes can take place entirely online via
                    the use of a laptop or mobile device. Hybrid versions of learning combine the use of technology from
                    anywhere with regular in-person classroom sessions. In both scenarios, the use of technology to
                    tailor learning plans for each student is possible. Teachers can create lessons based on student
                    interests and strengths. An added benefit is that students can learn at their own pace is there is
                    anykind of lockdown going through out the country example: Covid-!9. When they need to review class
                    material to get a better understanding of essential concepts, students can review videos in the
                    lesson plan.

                <h4>Depression and Other Mental Health Issues</h4>
                <p>College depression statistics show that students’ mental health has steadily declined since the
                    pandemic. A survey of 45,000 college students conducted at nine public research universities,
                    including both undergraduate and graduate students, found that more than one-third of college
                    students were suffering from major depression or anxiety disorder in 2020. These college depression
                    rates were twice as high as in 2019, and the anxiety rates were 1.5 times higher.There are multiple
                    factors involved, including pressure to succeed in academics, financial stress, uncertainty about
                    which major or career path to choose, increased social media use.

                <h4>Cyberbullying</h4>
                <p>You may already know that cyberbullying is the use of the Internet, cell phones, video game systems
                    or other technology to send or post messages intended to hurt or embarrass someone else. The
                    National Crime
                    Prevention Council puts that number even higher, at 43%. The NCPC also reports: <br>

                    • Seventeen percent of teens were victimized by someone lying about them online <br>

                    • Thirteen percent of teens learned that a cyberbully was pretending to be them while communicating
                    with someone else <br>

                    Yet only 11% of teens speak with their parents about incidents of cyberbullying.
